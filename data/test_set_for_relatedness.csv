"Good morning, @GovernorVA 1 in 4 diabetics ration #insulin & are a breath away from death due to @phrma collectively price-gouging a 100 yo drug. What are you doing to help Virginia diabetics access affordable #insulin4all?",1
We should cap the price of insulin at $35/month.,1
"$500, HOLY Moly, that's just plain wrong. I have three different types of insulin pens, a few shots per day, cost to me, zero. Shocking price you all have to pay to satisfy shareholders.",1
What about gun safety?  What about climate change? What about health care?  What about jobs?  What about unaffordable rent?  Did you talk about how Republicans voted against gas price gouging and insulin and help with baby formula?Biden has no control over gas prices. Fearmonger!,0
Why don't you shut your mouth you hypocrite. You had a chance to vote against price gouging you didn't and where is my $35 cap on insulin That's why they call you RepubliPukes,1
"But people with chronic conditions don’t have a choice. Diabetics would have to pay full price for insulin, asthmatics would have to pay full price for inhalers. The list goes on",1
The price of insulin went up 300% during Trump's watch.,1
yeah even at a better price point there’s nothing that makes me want to spend another several hundred bucks on a thing. the only thing i can imagine doing semi-regularly is watching movies on it,1
I’ll never have access cause Utah charges 150-200$ for the medical card and not everyone here can afford that price. 60$ an 8th to me thats a rip off. Now i have the same idea what a #Diabetic deals with when they can’t afford there insulin same concept.,1
People literally dying of DKA because they can't afford to buy a life saving drug,1
"oh the “perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite” of it all",0
Eating some sweet and salty nut,0
was eating a sweet mango in darkness till I switched on the lights,0
Sometimes people are surprised that I tackled type 2 #diabetes while eating a lot fruit.,1
Once you stop eating sugar even the tiniest amount of sweet shit will make you feel as if you have diabetes,0
So pharmacies are to blame for sky high insulin prices??,1
Just watch your daily news and you would know about this stuff! Formula shortage in US. and pharmacy prices high in US.,0
Only one thing to be applauded for...the ambulance charges are  much affordable but l don't understand your public hospital prices are way to high yet there's no medication everything is found in private clinics and pharmacies in hard cash$...,1
Except the middle is drowning. Insane inflation. Now crazy interest rates. Gas prices up another 10 cents in one week. Student debt. Pharmacy cost out of control. Co-payments at an all time high. I still believe in you but it’s a struggle.,0
"The following information has negative implications beyond the surface. Faced with high drug prices, seniors are abandoning cancer drugs at the pharmacy",1
"Faced with high drug prices, seniors are abandoning cancer drugs at the pharmacy",1
"As pharmacy benefit managers have come under scrutiny for their role in high drug prices, the industry is ripe for disruption by policymakers and new competitors.",1
Who is to blame for high #insulin prices in the USA? Big #Pharma? Not them. Try health insurers and evil Pharmacy Benefit Managers. ,1
Her blood sugar level is disturbed. Please send her a cake. That might help.,0
"Insulin is a natural hormone produced in the pancreas. Too much sugar inhibits the pancreatic production of insulin  which results in high blood sugar in humans. Ergo, diabetics require synthetic insulin otherwise they would die. The killer here is sugar, not insulin.",1
You can’t force feed a human an experimental diet and then dissect them afterward to elicit the full effect. But here’s a good human one. The elevated blood sugar increases peroxidation.,1
with multiple medical appointments for blood cholestrol + blood sugar + uric acid + hypertension?,1
"She’s also the reason that diabetic kids in OKC are allowed to keep their needles, insulin & blood sugar meters on them because they used to tell me I’d stab someone in class if I had my life saving medication with me",1
u wake up early after a night of drink bc your blood sugar is low and you are dehydrated so its your body yelling at you to help it lol,0
no no ! having a low blood sugar can increase chances of fainting and after getting a piercing your body will sort of react ? to the pain which half the time results in said fainting lol,0
The gluten free waffle revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for my blood sugar,0
i think it’s cause my blood sugar is low or smth idk that’s what google said besides menopause LMAO,0
I need to learn to eat when I'm drinking because my blood sugar just plummets if I don't,0
Janes Addiction - those two albums are both great. Blood Sugar is great but to me Mothers Milk is probably the weakest album out of the four,0
"Forgot to take my meds this morning. Pulled out my pill organizer, opened it, left it on bed without taking pills. Good job. My blood sugar is probably unacceptably high",1
"My doctor wants me to have a physical and blood work. Like no thank you I don't need your help to tell me I'm overweight, that my blood sugar & cholesterol are probably high. I can assume that all on my own I'm good.",1
"It  is a pre-diabetic condition, eventually leading to one. Diabetes is only if blood sugar levels start to be high.",1
"No. People with diabetes or high blood sugar, have weaker immune systems. This causes them to be easily infected by Herpesvirus.",1
"it comes to diabetes. without insulin, your body starts to shut down, organ by organ. it is excruciating. this can also happen when we aren’t getting enough insulin and are having issues with high blood sugar. there are so many different things that screw us up. it can be scary",1
"I have a former high school classmate who, like me, had type 1 diabetes. He died from an untreated low blood sugar episode. I don't need a lot of insulin, but I still need it...",1
"I have type 1 diabetes the worse for. I need nova-log insulin. I also had a birthday april 12th and landed in the dr for panic attacks and high blood sugar ,2 dTa after. I then lost my job fir nit being able yo work on the day i was in the er. Any thing would help",1
"You understand a lot of babies NEED formula to live. Allowing a can of milk formula to rise to a 100$ is not a solution, just like allowing insulin to reach 300$ isn't a solution either.",1
"People are dying because they can't afford insulin. If you have 0 dollars, $20 is out of reach.",1
Insulin is something a diabetic can’t live without. Making it affordable for everyone that needs it to survive isn’t even a discussion in normal times. Why should pharmaceuticals be out of reach to the general public. Price gouging is unacceptable.,1
O my God so cute and beautiful sweet heart I like you sweet heart,0
You sweet darling. I'm sorry if these are also your experiences but I'm relieved to know others can relate and that we aren't alone.,0
I won't ever give a person the chance to think sh*t sweet when it comes to me.,0
"Most populous nation in the world under communist regime’s non stop threat ... we didn’t see any real reforms, only talking sweet words challenges & propaganda without welfare, democratic principles",0
"That sounds scary. Not an expert at all, but if happening in morning ? Before any breakfast ? could it be linked to low blood sugar's ?",0
I take diabetes meds and if I didn't eat I would have a terrible reaction. Blood sugar would drop too much.,1
"All cards, have same blood sugar impact. Unless you are talking about taste",0
anyways i Am eating cheesecake for breakfast but in my defense my blood sugar will plummet if i don’t eat something sugary in the mornings,0
"Just because a patient does not get what they want, does not mean it was improper healthcare. Being a good doctor often means telling a patient what they don’t want to hear - that they need to lose weight, stop smoking, decrease blood sugar, don’t need surgery, etc.",0
"The doctor said that I have low blood sugar recently, but can not eat sugar, I asked what sugar I should eat, he said to eat your wedding candy",0
The problem is chocolate doesn't love me ... Blood Sugar problems ... Getting older sucks ...,0
"Sleep paralysis and low blood sugar, love that.",0
Make bullets as expensive as insulin.,0
If only bullets were as expensive as Epipens and insulin.,0
Voters will not forget how many New York Republicans voted against capping insulin payments at $35 per month.,0

oh for the last time INSULIN IS A HORMONE,0
oe Biden just said we can't be subject to the whims of a dictator. Then he said you can sell insulin at the price that he sets or you can't sell it at all,0
The ex is having a shit day at work. I brought him breakfast because I want him to take his insulin on time.,1
If the vaccine actually saved lives it would be priced so high you literally could not afford it. Like insulin and epinephrine.,1
Yep! I just went to get mine and I was told they are no longer covered. If I can’t afford to pay for the needles then I can’t take my insulin. The box of needles is almost $60.00.,1
In what other comparable countries do people die because they can’t afford insulin?,1
"Big pharma in America…. My Adderall, a literal controlled substance, is FREE but people are out there rationing life saving medication like insulin because they can’t afford to purchase it that often.",1
at the end of the day getting told to die slowly of diabetes and hoping someone’s family can’t afford insulin is way worse than what I said. It’s astonishing how everyone overlooked that part but again it is Twitter. if u disagree I think u are dumb but I digress,1
Insulin costs people with Type 1 diabetes up to $2000 per month in the US. Some ration it because they can't afford this high cost yet they also need it to live. We pay $5 for 3 months here in NZ thanks to Pharmac/Government funding.,1
People literally die because they can't afford insulin,1
Great. So they can look at their bank accounts and confirm they can't afford insulin because you care more about filibusters than healthcare.,1
gods will has allowed big pharma to make insulin cost $300,1
"Big pharma in America…. My Adderall, a literal controlled substance, is FREE but people are out there rationing life saving medication like insulin because they can’t afford to purchase it that often.",1

Oh plenty of direct calls from GPs in adults- we see and start insulin. Just high glucose and some ketones - not needing admission or going to ED,0
"Probably. My human has type 1 diabetes and when her glucose is high, she drinks more. High glucose makes you thirsty.",0

I have not checked my blood sugar in 48 hours. I'm surviving on insulin and vibes,1
If non diabetics need CGMs to tell them that their blood sugar rises when they eat then they deserve to pay extortionate amounts of money for them.,1
"No dear, please go on bitching at me for getting up early because my blood sugar was 55 & dropping instead of friggin helping me! Totally clueless as I’m in trouble standing right there in front of him. I’m still shaky 2 1/2 hours out from it. BAD low this AM, BAD.",0

"The fun part of only 45 minutes of sleep is drinking coffee to stay functional and forgetting to eat, so I can add stimulants and low blood sugar to the already miserable day.",0
So today I may have accidentally forgot that I had already taken my Metformin when I took it so I get to spend the rest of the day wondering if my blood sugar is going to suddenly dive without warning.,1
