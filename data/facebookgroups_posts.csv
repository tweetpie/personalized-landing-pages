Hello everyone! My name is Dominik Wiesniewski. I have been a Type One Diabetic for eight and a half years now. Over this time period I have struggled and battled this disease as well as many others. I have been shot down and been told there are many things I cannot do because of my diabetes. That was until I found music. It has helped me cope with my diabetes tremendously. Recently I have entered into a competition against many other talented musicians. I am currently in the second round trying to make it to the third and final round. For me to get there I have to get as many likes on the video in the link below. All I ask is if you could all take a couple seconds to like the video and help push me to the final round to show people around me how diabetes cannot stop me from accomplishing my goals!! If you could please CLICK on the VIDEO and LIKE it that will count as a VOTE!!

I'm type 1 and have been since the 70s. I exercise take my meds and eat portion sizes. That was what I was taught. Now I know there is more tech stuff now and advanced medicine now. But for over 40 years this is what I have done exercise meds and portion sizes and I eat everything. Dont believe in any of these diets. The movie is a good watch. 🙂🙂🎃🎃,706780043162520

He was having trouble with liquidity and one of his businesses was having major financial liquidity crisis, as a result his factory went to lockout state for nearly 1 year. A lot of trouble he was facing (including threat to his life from his rivals), employees and financial industries. I visited his factory 4 months back and gave healing to him and his factory, business. I spent 1 day with him to understand his business issues, litigations, employee issues,   bank debt issues. At the end of study, I gave him some healing remedies and we started healing his business issues from the last 4 months.  This morning, we received a call from my client saying that all business issues have been resolved and he is able to open up his factory from early next week.

I said I find that interesting because he keeps wanting to prescribe metformin for years (for polycystic ovarian syndrome) and I've always been borderline diabetic at 6.5%HA1C until last year when the doctor said I need to be at a 5.5% instead, so now I'm high and need Metformin and my HA1C in March was 7.3 and in July 8.5.  But my TSH has been increasing. This past March it was 9.01 and in July it was 11.63.  I told the pharmacist this and she said the Thyroid is ruling everything so first and foremost the thyroid needs to be controlled before anything else.

"Alternate therapy is enough... I am fed up of taking medicine Fact: Diabetes is a chronic disease which can be prevented but cannot be completely cured. Treatment for T2DM is a multifaceted approach that includes diet, nutrition, exercise, stress management and the necessary medications. Modern medicines and treatments with insulin therapy have come a long way in managing diabetes. However, some people seek alternative treatments as their only treatment for diabetes because of their attractive claims to completely cure diabetes. The use of alternate therapy alone is not supported in the medical community for T2DM. The ADA, for example, does not support the use of dietary supplements as a sole treatment for diabetes because of a lack of research-based evidence. • Ayurveda: It is an ancient system of medicine, practiced in India widely. The ayurvedic drugs available in India are usually a combination of root, bark or leaves of various plants and bhasmas of some metals. The safety and efficacy of these drugs is not scientifically established. In conventional doses, these drugs can normalise blood glucose in newly detected type 2 diabetics; however, in long-standing diabetes mellitus treatment, they are found to be ineffective. Since the plant extracts are being used, these drugs do not undergo similar safety trials and regulatory checks as modern medication and therefore one cannot be sure of its contents and efficiency and effect on hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. High level of metal constituents can lead to liver damage • Homeopathy and Unani: These therapies are used to cure many chronic diseases, however, there are no controlled trials on homeopathy or unani as a sole treatment for T2DM • Accupressure: Acupressureisa technique that involves placing pressure on strategic points in the body to produce similar effects to acupuncture. These techniques do not aim to cure diabetes, but instead aim to help a person’s body function more optimally. • Relaxation techniques: Although high stress levels are associated with high blood glucose levels, techniques like yoga and meditation are not associated with improvements in diabetes measurements, such as glycaemic control or improvements in HbA1c tests These alternative therapies may play a role in a modest way to control blood sugars, however, there is not enough scientific evidence and safety trials for their use as the only treatment for diabetes. They may be used as adjunct therapy only under medical supervision. The last thing anyone would want is to stop medication completely, take alternate therapy with no benefit and end up being hospitalised with life-threatening high blood sugar or with a stroke, heart attack or other complications as a result of uncontrolled T2DM.

"High Blood Sugar: Hyperglycemia is the technical term for high blood glucose (blood sugar). High blood glucose happens when the body has too little insulin or when the body can't use insulin properly. What Causes Hyperglycemia? A number of things can cause hyperglycemia: > If you have type 1, you may not have given yourself enough insulin. > If you have type 2, your body may have enough insulin, but it is not as effective as it should be. > You ate more than planned or exercised less than planned. > You have stress from an illness, such as a cold or flu. > You have other stress, such as family conflicts or school or dating problems. > You may have experienced the dawn phenomenon (a surge of hormones that the body produces daily around 4:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.). What are the Symptoms of Hyperglycemia? The signs and symptoms include the following: > High blood glucose > High levels of sugar in the urine > Frequent urination > Increased thirst Part of managing your diabetes is checking your blood glucose often. Ask your doctor how often you should check and what your blood glucose levels should be. Checking your blood and then treating high blood glucose early will help you avoid problems associated with hyperglycemia.",834876236635589

"The panel recommends the target HbA1c to increase microvascular benefits is 7 percent or less (53 mmol/mol) for most nonpregnant adults with sufficient life expectancy, with individualization based on patient preferences and goals; risk of adverse effects including hypoglycemia and weight gain; and patient characteristics including frailty and comorbid conditions. The cost, adherence and tolerability burdens have been added as factors to be considered for all medication therapy.  The report suggests that a patient's medication-taking and self-management behavior (adherence) be specifically considered as part of the decision cycle, ensuring a good match between patient and care plan. Inconsistent medication-taking behavior affects almost half of people with diabetes, which leads to suboptimal blood glucose control and increased CVD risk. All patients should be offered access to ongoing Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) programs in order to help patients cope with the daily challenges of living with diabetes, which can increase adherence to the diabetes care plan. DSME/S programs provide essential information to increase patient's ability to successfully and effectively manage their diabetes every day.",1737900216333182

But the other two are way off , Or is the latest ( newest model which is the accu chek guide ) telling me different, Bare in mind, I'm in Australia and the latest one that i use, I did have to pay for it outright unfortunately, Which i think cost me around $60.  But anyway, This is probably why i don't test myself more than i should anymore, as there are so many false testers out there, That says I'm fine, But im completely not, That's why i go off how im feeling and can guess my reading, and I'm normally correct...

"What is an Anti-Inflammatory Diet?Did you know that research has found a link between inflammation and increased risk for chronic diseases? And, these studies suggest that heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity might be due to chronic inflammation.INFLAMMATION IS A NORMAL BODY RESPONSE TO PROMOTE HEALINGInflammation is a sign that the immune system is fighting infection. The infection may be related to germs, wounds, allergens, toxins or other causes.Typically, we think of signs of inflammation as redness, swelling and pain. But, sometimes inflammation can happen within our bodies. Someone with bronchitis has a lung infection. The lungs may become inflamed. And, this may be a sign that their immune system is working to fight that infection. Eexcess body fat may promote changes in the body cells that promote chronic inflammation. The signs of inflammation may not be obvious. For others, chronic inflammation may relate to a problem with their immune system.Whatever the cause, long term chronic inflammation may damage the body’s DNA, increasing the risk for cancer.WHAT WE KNOW AND DON’T KNOW ABOUT FOODS AND INFLAMMATIONVarious anti-inflammatory diets are promoted online. But, researchers are still figuring out how what we eat may affect inflammation. So far, it appears that eating a variety of nutritious foods may help reduce inflammation in the body. What we eat may help prevent and keep chronic inflammation in check. And, a healthy eating plan provides nutrients that help keep your immune system working well:Fruits and vegetables contain natural components called phytonutrients that may help protect against inflammation.Healthy fats, such as monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids, may help keep inflammation at bay.Foods high in saturated fats may increase inflammation. Plus, highly processed foods and other foods with trans fat also may be inflammatory.Five Dietary Approaches That May Help Reduce InflammationAre you looking for ways to help combat inflammation? Consider the following five steps:Step 1: Make Fruits and Vegetables Half Your PlateAim to include vegetables and fruits with every mealEat a variety of brightly colored vegetables and fruits:All forms count — including fresh, frozen, canned and dried. Just be sure to look for products with no added sugars and lower amounts of sodium.Focus on vegetables from each subgroup weekly, including dark green, red and orange vegetables, as well as beans and peas.Step 2: Be Smart about ProteinDon’t overdo the protein — five to six ounce equivalents per day is appropriate for most people that are moderately active. And, when it comes to protein, select fatty fish containing omega-3s a couple of times each week.Enjoy meatless meals with tofu, tempeh, and legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils.Choose leaner protein foods, such as skinless chicken or turkey or lean cuts of beef and pork.Include low-fat or fat-free dairy products, like skim milk and yogurt, which are lower in saturated fat.Minimize highly processed foods such as deli meat, bacon, and sausage.Step3: Choose Healthy FatsUse monounsaturated fats, including olive, safflower, sunflower, canola, peanut and avocado oils.Eat omega-3 rich foods:Enjoy salmon or another fatty fish two to three times per week.Snack on nuts, such as walnuts.Toss ground flaxseed, chia seeds and hemp seeds into salads and other dishes.Minimize highly processed foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils and high amounts of saturated fat.Step 4: Select Whole GrainsChoose whole-grain flours and cereals more often, rather than those made with refined flour.Include a variety of whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, millet and wheat berries.Step 5: Experiment with Fresh Herbs and SpicesInfuse flavor into your dishes by adding fresh herbs.Spice up your recipes by experimenting with spices.OTHER LIFESTYLE FACTORSThough what you eat is important, it's not the only factor that impacts chronic inflammation. To help stay healthy:Get adequate sleep — both quality and duration of sleep directly impact inflammation.Be active — regular physical activity has anti-inflammatory effects. Aim for 30 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a day on most days of the week.Achieve and maintain a healthy weight — excess body fat could contribute to increased inflammation.NEED HELP DESIGNING AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DIET?A registered dietitian nutritionist can help develop an eating plan that fits your unique lifestyle, taste preferences and medical needs.",2162819827174550

"BARLEY While grains typically spike blood sugar and don’t contain enough fiber to offset the rise, barley holds the honor of being the lowest-glycemic grain (of the grains officially tested so far). This means it is the grain with the least impact on blood sugar. A half-cup of cooked pearl barley contains 22 grams of carbs and 3 grams of fiber—but its fiber is the magical beta-glucan, a special kind of soluble fiber known to help people feel full longer, to have less of an effect on blood glucose, and to improve cholesterol numbers. If you can find the less processed, “hull-less” barley, you’ll get even more fiber and more blood sugar protection.

"Role of yoga/meditation in dealing with emotional issues in diabetes Stress whether emotional or physical, causes fluctuations in blood sugar levels, which can be a major health concern for people with diabetes. Emotional stress can be caused due to various factors such as being diagnosed with diabetes, adjusting to a diabetes treatment regimen or dealing with psychosocial pressures of the disease. Below are a few strategies which can be put into action to help diabetics deal better with their emotional issues.  Yoga/meditation should be suggested for a person with diabetes who is going through emotional stress. Yoga has been scientifically proven to be an effective mode of treatment for a person with anxiety, stress or depression  Diabetic patients should be encouraged to make pranayamas (breathing exercises) and a few minutes of daily meditation a daily routine. This helps to calm the mind and reduce stress, which in turn, reduces glucoagon and helps to bring the blood sugar in control  You should learn the right way to do asanas and meditation (breathing techniques) through your counseller or yoga teacher  Also you can learn asanas by means of videos or pictures online, which helps in improving blood sugar control – the asanas include vajrasana (kneeling pose), shoulder stand, plow pose, lying down body twist, bow posture, two-legged forward bend and sitting half-spinal twist.  Physical activity/exercise is another factor which helps in dealing with emotional issues for diabetic patients. Exercise causes the body to release chemicals called endorphins which trigger a positive feeling in the body  Diabetic patients should play some sport of their liking or engage in hobbies like dancing and swimming to make exercise time a fun time and it also gives them a chance to relieve stress  You should plan physical activity based on your personal health condition and should be at a time convenient for you in your daily routine to ensure compliance  Physical activity also helps to reduce weight, improves insulin sensitivity and thereby is an effective treatment for both managing blood sugar levels as well as psychological issues",1518315041625035

"Are you suffering from pain? What is pain? In healing terminology, pain is nothing but negative energy. Chronic pain is nothing but cumulative deposit of negative energy in your body part. It could be in your bones, joints, arms, muscles, organs or any part of the body. The negative emotions of our brain deposits negative energy in these organs. How and why do we get pain in the body or any organ? When the cells in the body get injured or damaged it releases chemicals called “Prostaglandins”. These chemicals then goes to brain hormone called “Endorphin” through our body nervous system. In Healing we can activate the damaged cells or injured cells immediately so there will not be any prostaglandins. Also, we can heal endorphins hormone, nervous system and all the injured cells so that pain can vanish immediately. The message going from nerve/nervous stem to brain can be blocked with the healing technique. The another advantage of Reiki Universal energy is that healer can automate the process of healing or you can practice it on daily basis by learning self-healing technique where as physiotherapy treatment pain relief is temporary. When the cells gets damaged or injured again, patient will get pain. Hence, pain become chronic in nature and exists throughout the lifetime enforcing patients to take pain killers/steroid injections or physiotherapy treatment. Watch this video ",1184532274979747

"Myth: Eating too much sugar causes diabetes / Jaggery or honey does not cause blood sugar to rise. Fact: Diabetes happens due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Eating too much sugar does not lead to diabetes but weight gain due to excess calorie consumption from sugar can be one of the risk factors for diabetes. However, if one has diabetes, eating sugar will lead to high blood glucose levels. Further the new WHO guideline recommends adults and children to reduce their daily intake of free sugars to lee than 10% of their total energy intake. A further reduction to below 5% or roughly 25 grams (6 teaspoons) per day would provide additional health benefits. For a diabetic, sugar / jaggery / honey all are the same and can cause equal harm.",1497878980335308

So I understand the seriousness of my condition (Type 2 Diabetes) but I feel like I’m not doing anything about it. Has anyone been in my shoes?

"I am a type 1 diabetic, so I take only insulin for blood sugar control.  I have a question for all you type 2-ers out there... It seems that many type 2 diabetics view using insulin as a failure of some kind, or as something to avoid at all costs.  I understand wanting to control your diabetes without meds, but I don't understand why insulin is somehow worse than having to go on other t y or 2 meds, like pills.  Isn't insulin just another tool, like any of the pills that you might take?  In fact, it seems like it might be preferred since it doesn't have side effects like many other meds.  Yet I see time and time again people posting about how they will do anything to avoid having to ""resort"" to using insulin...like its the worst thing that can happen!  People seem much more willing to take pills which can have many negative side effects.   Please help me understand as I am truly curious.  Why is it so important to avoid insulin?  Thank you!",415468608960333

"# Dealing Diabetes # For type 2 diabetes, you can eat a small meal every 2 - 3 hours. When you eat smaller amounts of food, your blood sugar levels are lower after eating. Mini meals spread over the day may help control your hunger and calorie intake, leading to better blood glucose control and weight loss. Your blood cholesterol levels will also be lower.",951312054992006
